<p>Dr. Langlotz serves as Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University.  The goal of his research is to improve the accuracy and consistency of radiology communication through real-time decision support systems and other information technologies. His biomedical informatics research laboratory develops novel machine learning and natural language processing algorithms that provide intelligent assistance to radiologists, clinicians, patients, and other consumers of the radiology report.  The laboratory encourages translational work and after assessment of clinical effectiveness, encourages commercialization and dissemination of the resulting technologies.</p>

## Software and Informatics Work
<p>Dr. Langlotz has led many recent national and international efforts to improve the quality of radiology reports, including the <a href="http://radlex.org" target="_blank">RadLex™ terminology standard</a>, the <a href="http://playbook.radlex.org" target="_blank">RadLex™ Playbook</a> of radiology exam codes, the <a href="http://radreport.org/" target="_blank">RSNA report template library</a>, and a <a href="http://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_MRRT.pdf" target="_blank">technical standard</a> (PDF) for communication of radiology templates.</p>


<p>As Associate Chair for Information Systems in the <a href="http://radiology.stanford.edu/">Department of Radiology</a> and Medical Informatics Director for <a href="http://stanfordhealthcare.org/">Stanford Health Care</a>, Dr. Langlotz works with Information Technology Services to manage imaging informatics activities supporting the clinical, research, and educational missions of the Stanford Radiology.</p>
