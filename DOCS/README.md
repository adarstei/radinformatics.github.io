Welcome to the DOCS for working with the site! Here are some good places to start:

- [Set up development](DOCS/setting-up-development.md): This will tell you how to fork and clone the repo, and install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is written in ruby, and generates static sites for Github pages. Rest assured you don't need to do anything harder than write text files to contribute!
- [Add your bio](DOCS/adding-your-bio.md): This is likely what most want to do, adding a bio (picture and text) to show up on the site.
- [Submit your changes](DOCS/working-with-github.md): This is an overview of how to get your changes back onto Github!

If you need help at any point in this process, submit an issue or ping @vsoch. Feel free to update / change the docs and do anything to make the site better!
