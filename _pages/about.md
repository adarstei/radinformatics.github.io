The Radiology Informatics Lab at Stanford Medicine engages in research to improve real-time decision support systems and other information technologies. This means focusing on the development of novel machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to provide intelligent assistance to radiologists, clinicians, patients, and other consumers of biomedical imaging and reporting documents. To ensure dissemination of these algorithms, the lab takes a heavy focus on software and infrastructure development.
